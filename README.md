# Echolux: Retro-Technical Website

A minimal, retro-technical landing page for **Echolux** — a professional analog photography simulation app for iOS.

## Design Philosophy
- Inspired by European technical documentation, Leica manuals, and retro-futuristic engineering sheets
- Monospaced typography, minimal color palette (black, white, muted green)
- Terminal/console-inspired layout, technical overlays, and precise geometry
